### How Do I Get the Widget on my Website?

Under the Calendar tab you will see a link called Get Embed Code. Click on this link
and a popup will come up with a block of code. Copy the entire code block and paste it into the HTML
of your website where you want your widget to appear. We also offer free technical assistance
getting your widget embedded on your website if you are having problems getting it to look right.
Email <b>help@consultationkit.com</b> and we will be happy to get you all set up!

### How Do I Get Paid?

We integrate directly with your PayPal account so customers pay you directly. We make sure the payment
goes through before we make a booking on your calendar.

### Can I Customize My Widget?

Yes you can! You are able to create and adjust blocks of time that will show you as available
on your widget. By default it is set Monday - Friday from 9am - 5pm in your Timezone.
You can then customize the consultation length, price and padding between bookings.

### What If I Don't Use Google Calendar?

Currently we only support integration with Google Calendar. We are working hard to
get other calendars integrated. If you use a different set of tools than Google Calendar and PayPal
feel free to send an email to <b>info@consultationkit.com</b> so we know we are working on the
right thing for you!

### How Do I Mark Myself As Busy?

Create an event on your Google Calendar for the day and time that you are unavailable. Your widget
automatically places availability slots around conflicts on your calendar.

### Why Do I Have No Available Slots For A Whole Day?

Check to see if you have a full day event on your Google Calendar. We mark you as unavailable for full
day events so that you can easily mark youself as busy for long periods of time.

### How Many Reminders Do You Send?

We send clients an initial email the day they book that contains the booking information as well
as a Google Hangout link, skype username or phone number that will be used when you contact them.
They will recieve additional reminders 24 hours before the appointment and 1 hour before the appointment.

### How Do I Handle Cancellations or Appointment Changes?

All cancellations and changes should be handled outside of Consultation Kit. You can refund
customers if neccesary though PayPal and if an appointment is moved simply move the event on
your Google Calendar to the new time slot to ensure you don't double book.

### Who Has Access to My PayPal and Google Accounts?

Only you have access to both your PayPal and Google Accounts. When you grant us
permission to these services on signup we only recieve credentials to read and write to
your calendar and to allow you to recieve payments. We have no control over either account.
We cannot charge you without your knowledge, read your emails, see your documents etc.
In addition we will never use the information we do have about you for any reason other than
for booking you consultations. If you want to check or revoke permissions for any reason you can visit:

<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions?pli=1">https://myaccount.google.com/permissions?pli=1</a>
<br><br>
Note: If you revoke permissions your widget will no longer work.
